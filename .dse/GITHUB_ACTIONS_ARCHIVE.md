# GitHub Actions Archive Documentation

## Overview

These GitHub Actions workflows were removed during Token Studio integration cleanup (Epic 4 V2 completion). They were causing push conflicts with Token Studio and are non-functional in current state.

## Archived Workflows

### 1. `.github/workflows/update-tokens.yml`
**Purpose**: Auto-update tokensource.json when tokens/ directory changes
**Status**: Non-functional, removed due to Token Studio conflicts
**Features**:
- Comprehensive validation pipeline (TypeScript, ESLint, tests)
- Token consolidation from tokens/ to tokensource.json
- Round-trip validation testing
- Automated commit with detailed metadata
- File size and token set counting
- Loop prevention with commit message markers

**Key Capabilities**:
- 214 lines of comprehensive workflow logic
- Multi-stage validation and error handling
- GitHub Actions summary generation
- Integration with Token Studio raw URL

### 2. `.github/workflows/split-tokensource.yml`
**Purpose**: Split tokensource.json back to modular tokens/ files
**Status**: Non-functional, removed (tokensource.json now obsolete)
**Features**:
- Bidirectional token sync
- Automatic splitting when tokensource.json modified
- Loop prevention (skip if triggered by update-tokens workflow)
- Validation and error handling

### 3. `.github/workflows/main.yml`
**Purpose**: General CI/CD pipeline
**Status**: Basic build/test pipeline, may be functional
**Features**:
- Build, test, lint validation
- General repository health checks

## Removal Reason

Token Studio now supports direct file integration, making the complex tokensource.json consolidation system obsolete. The workflows were also causing push conflicts preventing Token Studio from syncing changes back to GitHub.

## Epic 6 Scope

**Future Automation Rewrite**:
- Design workflows compatible with Token Studio direct file approach
- Create validation that doesn't interfere with Token Studio pushes
- Build new automation for OKLCH optimization pipeline
- Integrate with Token Studio's separate file workflow

## Technical Notes

**Original Workflow Triggers**:
- `update-tokens.yml`: Triggered on `tokens/**` path changes
- `split-tokensource.yml`: Triggered on `tokensource.json` changes
- Loop prevention between workflows using commit message detection

**Integration Points**:
- Raw GitHub URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edmondmiu/DS-Simulate/main/tokensource.json`
- Token validation scripts in `scripts/` directory
- Build system integration via npm scripts
