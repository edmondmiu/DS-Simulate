## Future-Proofing Implementation

### Automation Framework
**New Color Guidelines (6-Step Process):**
1. Determine color purpose (neutral vs brand/accent)
2. Select appropriate base (Cool Neutral vs Amber)
3. Extract or define target hue and chroma
4. Apply OKLCH lightness stepping from base
5. Validate Delta E < 2.0 and harmony requirements
6. Test accessibility compliance and brand separation

**Auto-Detection Rules:**
- **Neutral Triggers**: Keywords (neutral, grey, surface, etc.) OR chroma <0.03
- **Brand Triggers**: Keywords (brand, primary, accent, etc.) OR chroma ≥0.03
- **12 Keywords Total**: 6 neutral + 6 brand detection terms

### Quality Assurance Protocol
**Mandatory Checks (3):**
- Delta E validation (<2.0 from optimized version)
- Harmony score maintenance (≥0.7 system-wide)
- Accessibility foundation (appropriate lightness range)

**Recommended Checks (3):**
- Brand separation (≥15° hue difference)
- Contrast validation (against common backgrounds)
- Semantic appropriateness (color matches intended use)

**Automated Fixes (3):**
- Lightness adjustment for accessibility
- Chroma normalization for purpose alignment
- Hue preservation during optimization

### Governance Framework
**Approval Required (3 scenarios):**
- New brand colors
- Base color changes
- System-wide modifications

**Automatic Approval (3 scenarios):**
- Neutral additions following guidelines
- Accessibility improvements
- Mathematical corrections under threshold

**Documentation Required (3 items):**
- Decision rationale
- Validation results
- Impact assessment
