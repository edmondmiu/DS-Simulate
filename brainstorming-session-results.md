# Brainstorming Session Results

**Session Date:** August 4, 2025
**Facilitator:** Mary, Business Analyst
**Participant:** You

### **Executive Summary**

- **Topic:** A multi-brand, themeable design system for a betting game application.
- **Session Goals:** To define a solution that streamlines the designer-to-developer workflow, supports client-specific branding (including light/dark modes), and has long-term commercial value.
- **Techniques Used:** Role Playing (Designer, Design System Engineer, Component Developer).
- **Key Themes Identified:** The system must be "accessible by design" through a robust token architecture; the developer and designer experience is paramount; and a phased approach, starting with a core pipeline and evolving towards advanced AI-driven automation, is the best path forward.

### **Technique Sessions**

We used a **Role Playing** technique to explore the needs and pain points of the key personas involved in the design system:

- **The Designer:** The primary consumer of the tokens in Figma. Their workflow needs to be simple, fast, and reliable, centered around the Token Studio plugin.
- **The Design System Engineer (DSE):** The creator and manager of the token architecture. Their workflow will be accelerated by custom scripts and AI assistance.
- **The Component Developer:** The consumer of the transformed tokens. Their workflow needs to be efficient, with easy discovery and testing of tokens.

### **Idea Categorization**

#### **1. Immediate Opportunities** (Core MVP of the Design System)

- Establish a multi-layered token architecture with the specific file structure provided, using a `tokens/` directory for modular editing and compiling to a single `tokensource.json`.
- Ensure the entire token system is optimized for the Designer's consumption within Figma via the Token Studio plugin, using a raw GitHub URL for import.
- Create the algorithmic, script-based tools (`split-source-to-tokens`, `consolidate-to-source`) for the DSE.
- Use Style Dictionary as the engine to transform `tokensource.json` into multi-platform outputs (`/dist`).
- Establish and document the disciplined Figma design practices required for the system to function correctly.

#### **2. Future Innovations** (The Next Version)

- Build a web-based UI for the DSE to visually manage the token structure.
- Set up Storybook with a theme-switching toolbar to enhance the Component Developer's workflow.
- Develop an AI "co-pilot" to assist the DSE in suggesting and generating color palettes.

#### **3. Moonshots** (Ambitious, Transformative Goals)

- Implement a "Design-to-Code" pipeline using the **Figma Dev Mode MCP Server** and an AI agent to automatically generate component boilerplate in the developer's IDE.

### **Action Planning**

Based on our discussion and the detailed information you provided, here is the prioritized, immediate action plan:

1.  **Formally Document the Architecture:** Using the project structure and workflow diagrams you provided as the blueprint, the first step is to create a formal architecture document. This will be the guide for the AI "Tooling Developer."
2.  **Build the Core Engineering Scripts:** Develop the initial scripts for the engineering workflow:
    - `split-source-to-tokens`: To break down the master `tokensource.json` into the modular `tokens/` directory structure.
    - `consolidate-to-source`: To compile the `tokens/` directory back into the master `tokensource.json`.
3.  **Implement the Style Dictionary Pipeline:** Configure Style Dictionary to process the `tokensource.json` and generate the initial target outputs in the `/dist` folder (e.g., CSS Custom Properties for React).
4.  **Create the Designer & DSE Guides:** Write the initial documentation that outlines:
    - The required Figma best practices for designers.
    - The step-by-step GitHub-centric workflow for the DSE.

### **Reflection & Follow-up**

This session was highly effective because we collaboratively moved from a broad problem statement to a specific, technical, and actionable plan.

The clear next step would be to use these results as the input for a formal **Project Brief** or **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**. This would kick off the development lifecycle.
