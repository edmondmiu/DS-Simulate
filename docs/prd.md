# Design System Tooling Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### **1. Goals and Background Context**

#### **Goals**

- To create a design system that streamlines the workflow between designers and developers.
- To support multiple, distinct client brands from a single, scalable token architecture.
- To ensure every brand theme supports both light and dark modes that are accessible by design.
- To establish a highly automated, script-based workflow for the Design System Engineer to enable manual creation and compilation of the token source.
- To deliver tokens in a multi-platform format, enabling consumption by any front-end application (initially targeting React and Flutter).

#### **Background Context**

The primary problem is the inefficiency and potential for error when translating multi-brand, multi-theme designs into code for the betting game application. The current process lacks a single source of truth for design tokens, leading to inconsistencies and slow onboarding of new client brands.

This PRD outlines a plan to create a centralized design system built on a robust, multi-layered token architecture. The system will be managed by a Design System Engineer (DSE), who will use a suite of scripts to manage and compile themes. These tokens will be transformed via Style Dictionary into platform-specific formats, ensuring designers in Figma and developers on various platforms are always working from the same source of truth.

#### **Change Log**

| Date        | Version | Description            | Author   |

### **2. Requirements**

#### **Functional Requirements**

- **FR1:** The system must provide a `consolidate-to-source` script that compiles the modular `tokens/` directory into a single `tokensource.json`, following the process outlined in the _Token Studio Export and Source Guide_.
- **FR2:** The system must use the Style Dictionary engine to transform the `tokensource.json` file into multiple platform-specific outputs, including CSS Custom Properties and Dart theme files.
- **FR3:** The `tokensource.json` file must be consumable by the Figma Token Studio plugin via a raw GitHub URL to support the designer workflow.
- **FR4:** The system must allow a Design System Engineer to manually create and define a new brand's complete token set within the `tokens/` directory, adhering to the file structure (`$metadata.json`, `$themes.json`, `core.json`, etc.) defined in the _Token Studio Export and Source Guide_.
- **FR5:** The system must provide a `split-source-to-tokens` script that can deconstruct the `tokensource.json` file back into the modular `tokens/` directory structure for editing.

#### **Non-Functional Requirements**

- **NFR1:** All system scripts must be executable via the command-line, enabling a developer or an AI agent to operate the system from within an IDE.
- **NFR2:** The system's scripts and architecture must be documented with sufficient clarity to allow an AI agent to execute the workflow defined in the _Token Studio Export and Source Guide_.

### **3. User Interface Design Goals**

#### **Overall UX Vision**

The UX vision is twofold:

1.  **For the End-User:** To experience a seamless, high-quality, and performant betting application that feels completely native to the specific client's brand they are using. The transition between light and dark modes should be instant and flawless.
2.  **For the Internal Team:** To create a design and development process that is efficient, consistent, and error-proof, drastically reducing the time it takes to launch a new, fully-branded client experience.

#### **Key Interaction Paradigms**

The design system must support core interactions for a betting application, ensuring they are clear and intuitive across all themes. This includes clear data display for odds, a simple process for adding selections to a bet slip, and obvious visual feedback for state changes (e.g., bet placed, odds changed, win/loss status).

#### **Core Screens and Views**

Conceptually, the design system will need to provide components for the following key application views:

- Homepage / Event Lobby
- Live Game / Event View
- Search & Discovery
- Bet Slip
- User Account & Wallet
- Transaction History
- Login / Registration

#### **Accessibility: WCAG AA**

The system will be designed to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards by default. The token architecture, particularly the color system, is the primary mechanism for ensuring all brand themes meet required contrast ratios.

#### **Branding**

The core purpose of the UI is to be a flexible "canvas" for client branding. Branding is not just a "skin"; it is deeply integrated via the design token system. Every component must be fully themeable to reflect a client's unique brand identity in both light and dark modes.

#### **Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive & Cross-Platform Mobile**

The design system must produce styles and components that support both a fully responsive web application (React) and cross-platform mobile applications (Flutter).

### **4. Technical Assumptions**

#### **Repository Structure: Monorepo**

The project will be housed in a single monorepo to simplify management of the interconnected token source files, transformation scripts, and documentation.

#### **Service Architecture: CLI-Based Toolchain**

The project's architecture is a toolchain of command-line interface (CLI) scripts that perform build-time functions, rather than a traditional running service.

#### **Testing Requirements: Unit & Integration Tests for Scripts**

The testing focus will be on validating the token pipeline itself, ensuring the scripts and transformations produce reliable, correctly formatted outputs.

#### **Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests**

- **Primary Tooling Language:** Node.js for scripts.
- **Core Transformation Engine:** Style Dictionary.
- **Designer Interface:** Figma with the Token Studio plugin.
- **Source Control:** A GitHub-centric workflow.

### **5. Epic List**

- **Epic 1: Core Pipeline & Project Foundation**

  - **Goal:** Establish the monorepo, file structures, and core `consolidate`/`split` scripts to enable manual editing and compilation of the token source.

- **Epic 2: Designer Workflow Enablement**

  - **Goal:** Implement the GitHub-centric workflow, ensuring the compiled `tokensource.json` can be successfully imported and used by designers in Figma via the Token Studio plugin.

- **Epic 3: Developer Consumption Pipeline**
