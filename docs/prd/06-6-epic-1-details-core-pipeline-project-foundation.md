### **6. Epic 1 Details: Core Pipeline & Project Foundation**

**Expanded Goal:** This epic establishes the foundational skeleton of the entire design system's tooling. The primary outcome is a working, script-based pipeline that allows a Design System Engineer to manage token files locally. It delivers the core engine of the system, enabling the manual creation and compilation of the token source of truth.

**Stories:**

- **Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding**

  - **As a** Design System Engineer, **I want** a standardized monorepo structure set up, **so that** all the design system tooling and token assets have a clean, organized, and version-controlled home.

- **Story 1.2: Implement Consolidate Script**

  - **As a** Design System Engineer, **I want** a script (`consolidate-to-source`) that compiles the modular `tokens/` directory into a single `tokensource.json`, **so that** I have a single source of truth for consumption by other tools.

- **Story 1.3: Implement Split Script**

  - **As a** Design System Engineer, **I want** a script (`split-source-to-tokens`) that can deconstruct `tokensource.json` back into the modular `tokens/` directory, **so that** I can easily edit the source files.

- **Story 1.4: Create Initial Documentation**
  - **As a** Design System Engineer, **I want** a basic `README.md` file, **so that** I understand how to set up the project and use the core scripts.
