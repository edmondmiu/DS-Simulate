### **8. Epic 3 Details: Developer Consumption Pipeline (DEFERRED)**

**Status:** DEFERRED - See [ROADMAP.md](/docs/ROADMAP.md) for future implementation plans

**Expanded Goal:** This epic would complete the core value chain of the design system by getting the tokens into the hands of developers. The focus would be on integrating the Style Dictionary engine to transform the single source of truth (`tokensource.json`) into multiple, platform-specific formats. Upon completion, the token pipeline would be fully automated, and developers on both web and mobile platforms would have code-ready token files to use in their projects.

**Deferral Rationale:** This epic has been deferred due to complexity without immediate developer team demand, current Style Dictionary reference resolution challenges, and the strategic decision to perfect the designer workflow before adding developer consumption complexity.

**Stories (Planned for Future Implementation):**

- **Story 3.1: Install and Configure Style Dictionary**

  - **As a** Design System Engineer, **I want** Style Dictionary installed and configured in the monorepo, **so that** I have the core engine needed to perform token transformations.

- **Story 3.2: Create Web (CSS) Transform**

  - **As a** Web Developer, **I want** the token pipeline to generate a CSS file with all tokens as CSS Custom Properties, **so that** I can easily use the design system in any web project.

- **Story 3.3: Create Mobile (Dart) Transform**

  - **As a** Mobile Developer, **I want** the token pipeline to generate a Dart file with all tokens as theme constants, **so that** I can easily use the design system in our Flutter application.

- **Story 3.4: Automate the Transformation Pipeline**
  - **As a** Design System Engineer, **I want** the Style Dictionary transformation to be a single, runnable script integrated into our CI/CD pipeline, **so that** the developer-ready token files are always kept in sync automatically.
