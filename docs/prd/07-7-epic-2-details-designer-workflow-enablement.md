### **7. Epic 2 Details: Designer Workflow Enablement**

**Expanded Goal:** This epic makes the design system "real" for the designers. Its purpose is to establish a secure, remote source of truth in GitHub and validate the end-to-end workflow of syncing tokens into the Figma Token Studio plugin. Upon completion, a designer will be able to connect to the repository and use the defined tokens in their daily work.

**Stories:**

- **Story 2.1: Setup Remote Repository**

  - **As a** Design System Engineer, **I want** the project pushed to a remote GitHub repository with a protected main branch, **so that** we have a centralized, secure, and collaborative location for our source of truth.

- **Story 2.2: Automate `tokensource.json` Updates**

  - **As a** Design System Engineer, **I want** the `tokensource.json` file on the `main` branch to be automatically updated via a CI/CD action, **so that** the remote source of truth is always in sync with the latest token changes.

- **Story 2.3: Validate Figma Token Studio Integration**

  - **As a** Designer, **I want** to import the design tokens from our GitHub repository into Figma using the Token Studio plugin, **so that** I can use the official system tokens in my designs.

- **Story 2.4: Document the Designer Setup**
  - **As a** Designer, **I want** clear, step-by-step documentation on how to set up the Token Studio sync, **so that** I can quickly and easily connect to the design system.
