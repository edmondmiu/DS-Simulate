### **3. User Interface Design Goals**

#### **Overall UX Vision**

The UX vision is twofold:

1. **For the End-User:** To experience a seamless, high-quality, and performant betting application that feels completely native to the specific client's brand they are using. The transition between light and dark modes should be instant and flawless.
2. **For the Internal Team:** To create a design and development process that is efficient, consistent, and error-proof, drastically reducing the time it takes to launch a new, fully-branded client experience.

#### **Key Interaction Paradigms**

The design system must support core interactions for a betting application, ensuring they are clear and intuitive across all themes. This includes clear data display for odds, a simple process for adding selections to a bet slip, and obvious visual feedback for state changes (e.g., bet placed, odds changed, win/loss status).

#### **Core Screens and Views**

Conceptually, the design system will need to provide components for the following key application views:

- Homepage / Event Lobby
- Live Game / Event View
- Search & Discovery
- Bet Slip
- User Account & Wallet
- Transaction History
- Login / Registration

#### **Accessibility: WCAG AA**

The system will be designed to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards by default. The token architecture, particularly the color system, is the primary mechanism for ensuring all brand themes meet required contrast ratios.

#### **Branding**

The core purpose of the UI is to be a flexible "canvas" for client branding. Branding is not just a "skin"; it is deeply integrated via the design token system. Every component must be fully themeable to reflect a client's unique brand identity in both light and dark modes.

#### **Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive & Cross-Platform Mobile**

The design system must produce styles and components that support both a fully responsive web application (React) and cross-platform mobile applications (Flutter).
