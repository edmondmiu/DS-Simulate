### **9. Epic 4 Details: DSE Color Management**

**Status:** READY FOR REVIEW - Advanced color management with OKLCH integration and .dse/ architecture completed

**Expanded Goal:** This epic establishes a sophisticated color management system that separates DSE-specific configurations from Token Studio mirror files. The focus is on implementing OKLCH color space support, perceptually uniform accessibility validation, and a clean architectural separation between DSE color management configurations and Token Studio compatibility. Upon completion, the system will provide industry-leading color science capabilities while maintaining seamless Token Studio integration.

**Architecture Overview:**
- **DSE Configuration Directory (`.dse/`)**: Contains OKLCH color configurations and DSE-specific settings
- **Token Studio Mirror Directory (`tokens/`)**: Pure mirror of Token Studio format specifications  
- **Enhanced Consolidate Pipeline**: Reads from `.dse/` configurations and processes color tokens using OKLCH
- **Clean Separation**: DSE configurations preserved independently from Token Studio files

**Stories:**

- **Story 4.1: Implement .dse/ Architecture Foundation**

  - **As a** Design System Engineer, **I want** the .dse/ directory architecture established with color-library.json configuration, **so that** DSE-specific configurations are cleanly separated from Token Studio mirror files.

- **Story 4.2: OKLCH Color Space Integration**

  - **As a** Design System Engineer, **I want** OKLCH color space support integrated into the consolidate pipeline, **so that** we can leverage perceptually uniform color science for accessibility and modern color workflows.

- **Story 4.3: Enhanced Color Validation and Accessibility**

  - **As a** Design System Engineer, **I want** comprehensive color validation using OKLCH perceptual metrics, **so that** we can ensure accessibility compliance and color consistency across all brand variations.

- **Story 4.4: Token Studio Compatibility Preservation**

  - **As a** Designer, **I want** the enhanced color management to maintain full Token Studio compatibility, **so that** I can continue using Figma Token Studio workflows without disruption.

- **Story 4.5: Advanced Color Generation Pipeline**
  - **As a** Design System Engineer, **I want** automated color ramp generation using OKLCH perceptual uniformity, **so that** we can create consistent, accessible color scales across all brand themes.

**Key Deliverables:**

1. **DSE Configuration System**: `.dse/color-library.json` with OKLCH parameters, accessibility thresholds, and color generation rules
2. **OKLCH Integration**: Color space conversion and generation capabilities with perceptual uniformity
3. **Enhanced Validation**: Multi-format color validation supporting hex, RGB, and OKLCH
4. **Accessibility Compliance**: OKLCH-based accessibility validation using perceptual metrics
5. **Architecture Separation**: Clean separation between DSE configurations and Token Studio mirror files

**Technical Requirements:**

- **Color Space Library**: OKLCH color processing with conversion utilities
- **Configuration Schema**: Structured color-library.json with validation
- **Pipeline Integration**: Enhanced consolidate script with OKLCH capabilities
- **Round-trip Compatibility**: Maintain perfect Token Studio import/export workflows
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient processing of large token sets with color conversion

**Success Criteria:**

- DSE configurations in `.dse/color-library.json` control color generation and validation
- OKLCH color space integration provides perceptually uniform color processing  
- Token Studio compatibility preserved with zero workflow disruption
- Color accessibility validation uses modern perceptual uniformity metrics
- Architecture cleanly separates DSE configurations from Token Studio files
