### **4. Technical Assumptions**

#### **Repository Structure: Monorepo**

The project will be housed in a single monorepo to simplify management of the interconnected token source files, transformation scripts, and documentation.

#### **Service Architecture: CLI-Based Toolchain**

The project's architecture is a toolchain of command-line interface (CLI) scripts that perform build-time functions, rather than a traditional running service.

#### **Testing Requirements: Unit & Integration Tests for Scripts**

The testing focus will be on validating the token pipeline itself, ensuring the scripts and transformations produce reliable, correctly formatted outputs.

#### **Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests**

- **Primary Tooling Language:** Node.js for scripts.
- **Core Transformation Engine:** Style Dictionary.
- **Designer Interface:** Figma with the Token Studio plugin.
- **Source Control:** A GitHub-centric workflow.
