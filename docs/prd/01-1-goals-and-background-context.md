### **1. Goals and Background Context**

#### **Goals**

- To create a design system that streamlines the workflow between designers and developers.
- To support multiple, distinct client brands from a single, scalable token architecture.
- To ensure every brand theme supports both light and dark modes that are accessible by design.
- To establish a highly automated, script-based workflow for the Design System Engineer to enable manual creation and compilation of the token source.
- To deliver tokens in a multi-platform format, enabling consumption by any front-end application (initially targeting React and Flutter).

#### **Background Context**

The primary problem is the inefficiency and potential for error when translating multi-brand, multi-theme designs into code for the betting game application. The current process lacks a single source of truth for design tokens, leading to inconsistencies and slow onboarding of new client brands.

This PRD outlines a plan to create a centralized design system built on a robust, multi-layered token architecture. The system will be managed by a Design System Engineer (DSE), who will use a suite of scripts to manage and compile themes. These tokens will be transformed via Style Dictionary into platform-specific formats, ensuring designers in Figma and developers on various platforms are always working from the same source of truth.
