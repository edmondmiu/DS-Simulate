### 1. High-Level Architecture

#### Technical Summary

This project will be a **CLI-based toolchain** housed in a **monorepo**, built with **Node.js**. The core of the system is a **pipeline architecture** that transforms a modular set of JSON source files (tokens/) into a single, consolidated source of truth (tokensource.json). This file is then consumed by both the Figma Token Studio plugin for designers and the Style Dictionary engine. Style Dictionary acts as an **adapter**, converting the tokens into multiple platform-specific outputs (CSS, Dart) for consumption by developers. This architecture prioritizes automation, reliability, and a clear, single source of truth for all design and development workflows.

**Current Implementation Status:** Epic 2 (Designer Workflow) is complete. Epic 3 (Style Dictionary integration) is temporarily paused but will be implemented when developer consumption is needed.

#### High-Level Overview

- **Architectural Style:** The system is a **Build-Time Pipeline**, not a traditional running service. All operations are initiated on-demand by a user (the DSE) or a CI/CD process.
- **Repository Structure:** A **Monorepo** manages the interconnected components: token source files, transformation scripts, and configuration files.
- **Primary Data Flow:** The workflow is sequential: The DSE edits modular token files -> A consolidate script creates the master tokensource.json -> This file is synced to GitHub -> Token Studio pulls from GitHub for Figma integration -> Designers can edit in Figma and sync back to GitHub.

#### Architectural and Design Patterns

- **Monorepo Pattern:** Used for code organization.
  - _Rationale:_ Centralizes management of the related packages (scripts, configs, outputs) and simplifies dependency management and automated workflows.
- **CLI (Command-Line Interface) Pattern:** The primary interface for the tooling.
  - _Rationale:_ Highly efficient for script-based, on-demand tasks and ideal for automation in a CI/CD environment.
- **Pipeline Pattern:** Defines the data flow for tokens.
  - _Rationale:_ Creates a clear, sequential, and predictable process for transforming token data from its raw source to its final consumable formats.
- **Token Studio Integration Pattern:** Direct integration with Figma Token Studio.
  - _Rationale:_ Enables seamless designer workflows without intermediate transformation layers. Future developer consumption can be added when needed.
