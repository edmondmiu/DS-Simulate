### 9. Coding Standards and Test Strategy

- **Coding Standards:** The project will adhere to strict standards enforced by ESLint (for quality) and Prettier (for formatting). All code will be written in TypeScript with strong typing.
- **Test Strategy:** The Jest testing framework will be used. The focus will be on unit and integration tests for the scripts in the scripts/ directory. Tests will verify that the file transformations are correct and that the pipeline is reliable.
