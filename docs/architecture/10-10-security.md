### 10. Security

- **Primary Concern:** The security of the GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) used by the GitHub Actions workflow.
- **Mitigation:** The PAT will be stored as an encrypted repository secret in GitHub and will be configured with the minimum required permissions (write access to the repository).
- **Branch Protection:** The main branch will be protected to prevent direct pushes, ensuring all changes are processed and validated by the automated workflow.
