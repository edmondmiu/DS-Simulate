# Story 1.3: Implement Split Script

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** Design System Engineer,
**I want** a script (`split-source-to-tokens`) that can deconstruct `tokensource.json` back into the modular `tokens/` directory,
**so that** I can easily edit the source files.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The script reads the consolidated `tokensource.json` file and splits it into modular token files
2. The script follows the reverse process of the consolidate script
3. The script recreates the proper Token Studio file structure in the `tokens/` directory
4. The script preserves token structure, references, and metadata during splitting
5. The script is executable via command-line interface with configurable paths
6. The script includes proper error handling, validation, and backup capabilities

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: docs/stories/1.2.implement-consolidate-script.story.md]

The previous story established:
- Production-ready consolidate script with professional CLI interface
- Comprehensive token reference validation and circular dependency detection
- Full test coverage with integration tests validating real file operations
- Successfully consolidates project tokens (4 sets, 2028 bytes output)
- ES module TypeScript implementation with Node.js 20.11.1
- CLI patterns using process.argv with --help, --verbose, configurable paths
- Robust error handling patterns and user-friendly messaging

### Architecture Context

[Source: architecture/02-2-tech-stack.md]
- **Language:** TypeScript 5.4.5 - Primary language for all scripts
- **Runtime:** Node.js 20.11.1 - LTS version for stability  
- **Testing:** Jest 29.7.0 - Unit and integration testing framework
- **Coding Standards:** ESLint 8.57.0 for quality, Prettier 3.2.5 for formatting

[Source: architecture/07-7-source-tree.md]
- Script location: `scripts/split.ts`
- Input location: Root-level `tokensource.json`
- Output location: `tokens/` directory with modular token files
- Test location: `tests/` directory

[Source: architecture/03-3-data-models.md]
- **Design Token:** Atomic unit with $type, $value, $description
- **Token Set:** Logical grouping in JSON files (e.g., core.json)  
- **Theme:** Configuration with mode property ("light" or "dark")

### Token Studio Export and Source Guide Requirements

[Source: Token Studio Export and Source Guide.md]

**Reverse Consolidation Process (Split Operation):**
1. Parse the consolidated `tokensource.json` file
2. Extract each top-level token set (core, global, components, etc.)
3. Create individual JSON files for each token set with proper naming
4. Generate `$metadata.json` with token set order matching the original structure
5. Create or preserve `$themes.json` with theme configurations

**Expected Output Structure:**
```
tokens/
├── $metadata.json          # Token set order and configuration
├── $themes.json            # Theme definitions and mappings
├── core.json               # Core design tokens (color ramps, primitives)
├── global.json             # Global semantic tokens
├── global light.json       # Light theme overrides (with space in name)
└── components.json         # Component-specific tokens
```

**Token Set Naming Conventions:**
- Handle spaces in token set names (e.g., "global light" → "global light.json")
- Preserve exact naming from tokensource.json top-level keys
- Maintain file extension consistency (.json)

**Metadata Generation:**
```json
{
  "tokenSetOrder": [
    "core",
    "global", 
    "global light",
    "components"
  ]
}
```

**Round-Trip Compatibility:**
- Split operation must create files that consolidate script can read back
- Token references must be preserved exactly (e.g., `{Color Ramp.Amber.Amber 0500}`)
- Hierarchical structure must match original Token Studio export format

### Functional Requirements Context

[Source: docs/prd/02-2-requirements.md]
- **FR5:** Must provide `split-source-to-tokens` script for deconstructing tokensource.json
- **NFR1:** Must be executable via command-line for IDE and AI agent operation
- **NFR2:** Must be documented with sufficient clarity for AI agent execution

### Technical Implementation Patterns from Story 1.2

**CLI Interface Pattern:**
```typescript
// Follow established patterns from consolidate.ts
const args = process.argv.slice(2);
const options = {
  source: 'tokensource.json',
  tokensDir: 'tokens',
  verbose: false,
  dryRun: false,
  backup: true
};
```

**Error Handling Pattern:**
```typescript
try {
  // Validate input file exists
  // Parse JSON with descriptive error messages
  // Handle file system operations safely
} catch (error) {
  console.error(`Error: ${error.message}`);
  process.exit(1);
}
```

**File Operations Pattern:**
- Use fs.readFileSync/writeFileSync for synchronous operations
- Proper path joining with path.join()
- Directory creation with fs.mkdirSync({ recursive: true })
- JSON formatting with JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)

### Technical Constraints

- All code must be TypeScript with strong typing matching consolidate.ts patterns
- Must handle Node.js file system operations safely with proper error handling
- Command-line interface should match consolidate.ts conventions
- Output must be compatible with existing Token Studio workflow
- Backup functionality critical to prevent data loss during splitting operations

## Testing

### Testing Standards

[Source: architecture/09-9-coding-standards-and-test-strategy.md]
- **Test Framework:** Jest 29.7.0
- **Test Location:** All tests should be placed in the tests/ directory
- **Test Focus:** Unit and integration tests for scripts in scripts/ directory
- **Test Requirements:** Verify file transformations are correct and pipeline is reliable

### Specific Testing Requirements for this Story

Based on successful patterns from Story 1.2:
- Integration tests using actual script execution via command line
- Test fixtures with sample tokensource.json files of varying complexity
- Round-trip testing: consolidate → split → consolidate should produce identical results
- Backup and rollback functionality validation
- Error handling with invalid JSON and missing files
- Dry-run mode testing to ensure no files are written
- CLI help system and command-line argument validation
