# Story 2.2: Setup Remote Repository

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As a** Design System Engineer,
**I want** the project pushed to a remote GitHub repository with a protected main branch,
**so that** we have a centralized, secure, and collaborative location for our source of truth.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The project is pushed to a remote GitHub repository with complete history
2. The main branch is protected with branch protection rules enabled
3. The tokensource.json file is accessible via raw GitHub URL for Token Studio integration
4. Repository includes proper .gitignore, README.md, and project documentation
5. Repository is configured for collaborative development with proper permissions
6. Initial release/tag is created to mark the completion of Epic 1 foundation

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

**Epic 1 Complete Foundation:**
- ✅ Complete monorepo structure with professional TypeScript tooling
- ✅ Production consolidate/split scripts with comprehensive CLI interfaces
- ✅ Comprehensive project documentation (README.md with 452 lines)
- ✅ Complete test suite (11/11 tests passing)

**Epic 2.1 Multi-Brand Achievement:**
- ✅ Dynamic multi-brand token pipeline (unlimited scalability)
- ✅ Complete 7-token set integration (118,871 bytes tokensource.json)
- ✅ Professional import-export script for Token Studio integration
- ✅ Production-ready system supporting unlimited brands without code changes

### Architecture Context

[Source: architecture/02-2-tech-stack.md]
- **Source Control:** GitHub-centric workflow
- **CI/CD Platform:** GitHub Actions for automating token pipeline
- **Repository Structure:** Monorepo for managing interconnected packages

[Source: architecture/08-8-infrastructure-and-deployment.md]
- GitHub repository serves as the central source of truth
- Raw GitHub URLs enable direct Token Studio plugin integration
- Protected main branch ensures stability and review process

### Functional Requirements Context

[Source: docs/prd/02-2-requirements.md]
- **FR3:** tokensource.json must be consumable by Figma Token Studio plugin via raw GitHub URL
- **NFR1:** System must be operable by developers and AI agents from IDE

[Source: docs/prd/07-7-epic-2-details-designer-workflow-enablement.md]
- **Epic Goal:** "Establish a secure, remote source of truth in GitHub"
- **Success Criteria:** "Centralized, secure, and collaborative location for our source of truth"

### Repository Configuration Requirements

**Essential Repository Settings:**
- **Visibility:** Depends on organization requirements (private/public)
- **Branch Protection:** Main branch must be protected for stability
- **Topics:** Design system, tokens, multi-brand, figma, style-dictionary
- **Description:** Clear description for team discoverability

**File Structure to Push:**
```
design-system-tooling/
├── .github/workflows/          # CI/CD pipeline (ready for future automation)
├── docs/                      # Complete project documentation
├── scripts/                   # Production consolidate, split, import-export
├── src/                       # TypeScript utilities
├── tokens/                    # Complete 7-token set working directory
├── dist/                      # Compiled JavaScript (included in repo)
├── tests/                     # Comprehensive test suite
├── tokensource.json           # 118,871 bytes multi-brand source of truth
├── package.json               # Complete dependency configuration
├── README.md                  # 452 lines comprehensive documentation
└── style-dictionary.config.json # Ready for Epic 3
```

**Critical Files for Token Studio Integration:**
- `tokensource.json` - Must be accessible via raw GitHub URL
- `README.md` - Must display designer setup instructions
- `docs/` - Complete documentation for designer onboarding

### GitHub Integration Patterns

**Raw GitHub URL Format:**
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{username}/{repo-name}/main/tokensource.json
```

**Branch Protection Configuration:**
- Require pull request reviews: ✓ Minimum 1 reviewer
- Dismiss stale reviews: ✓ When new commits pushed
- Require review from code owners: ✓ (when CODEOWNERS file added)
- Restrict pushes to matching branches: ✓ Force PR workflow
- Require status checks: ✓ (ready for CI/CD integration)

**Repository Topics for Discoverability:**
- `design-system`
- `design-tokens`
- `multi-brand`
- `figma-tokens`
- `token-studio`
- `style-dictionary`
- `typescript`

### Security and Access Control

**Branch Protection Benefits:**
- Prevents direct pushes to main branch
- Ensures all changes go through review process
- Maintains stability of tokensource.json for designers
- Enables automated testing before merge (future CI/CD)

**Collaboration Readiness:**
- Repository structure supports team development
- Documentation enables independent contributor onboarding
- Protected workflows prevent accidental breaking changes
- Issue/PR templates guide proper contribution process

### Release Management

**Epic 1 Completion Release (v1.0.0):**
- Complete multi-brand token pipeline
- Production-ready consolidate/split/import-export scripts
- Comprehensive documentation and testing
- 118,871 bytes tokensource.json with 7 token sets
- Zero breaking changes from Epic 1 → Epic 2.1

**Release Highlights:**
- ✅ Unlimited brand scalability without code modifications
- ✅ Professional CLI interfaces with comprehensive help systems
- ✅ Complete Token Studio integration compatibility
- ✅ Enterprise-grade error handling and safety features
- ✅ Perfect round-trip validation (byte-for-byte accuracy)

### Integration Readiness

**Token Studio Plugin Integration:**
- Raw GitHub URL provides direct access to tokensource.json
- No authentication required for public repositories
- Automatic updates when main branch changes (future CI/CD)
- Stable URL format for designer bookmark/configuration

**CI/CD Foundation:**
- Repository structure ready for GitHub Actions
- Branch protection enables automated testing gates
- Protected main ensures stable tokensource.json delivery
- Foundation for Epic 2.3 automation implementation

## Testing

### Testing Standards

[Source: architecture/09-9-coding-standards-and-test-strategy.md]
- Repository setup should be validated by testing all access patterns
- Documentation links and examples should be verified to work
- Raw GitHub URLs should be tested for accessibility

### Specific Testing Requirements

**Repository Access Validation:**
- Test git clone from remote repository
- Verify all files pushed correctly with proper file sizes
- Test raw GitHub URL access to tokensource.json
- Validate README.md displays correctly on GitHub

**Branch Protection Testing:**
- Attempt direct push to main (should fail)
- Test pull request creation and review process
- Verify branch protection rules are enforced
- Test status check requirements (ready for CI/CD)

**Integration Readiness Testing:**
- Test tokensource.json URL in browser
- Verify JSON file downloads correctly (118,871 bytes)
- Test URL accessibility from different networks
- Validate file content matches local tokensource.json exactly

**Documentation Verification:**
- All documentation links work correctly on GitHub
- README.md examples are accurate for repository structure
- Project documentation displays properly in GitHub interface
- Repository topics and description are properly configured
