## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

**Epic 1 Complete Foundation:**
- ✅ Complete monorepo structure with professional TypeScript tooling
- ✅ Production consolidate/split scripts with comprehensive CLI interfaces
- ✅ Comprehensive project documentation (README.md with 452 lines)
- ✅ Complete test suite (11/11 tests passing)

**Epic 2.1 Multi-Brand Achievement:**
- ✅ Dynamic multi-brand token pipeline (unlimited scalability)
- ✅ Complete 7-token set integration (118,871 bytes tokensource.json)
- ✅ Professional import-export script for Token Studio integration
- ✅ Production-ready system supporting unlimited brands without code changes

### Architecture Context

[Source: architecture/02-2-tech-stack.md]
- **Source Control:** GitHub-centric workflow
- **CI/CD Platform:** GitHub Actions for automating token pipeline
- **Repository Structure:** Monorepo for managing interconnected packages

[Source: architecture/08-8-infrastructure-and-deployment.md]
- GitHub repository serves as the central source of truth
- Raw GitHub URLs enable direct Token Studio plugin integration
- Protected main branch ensures stability and review process

### Functional Requirements Context

[Source: docs/prd/02-2-requirements.md]
- **FR3:** tokensource.json must be consumable by Figma Token Studio plugin via raw GitHub URL
- **NFR1:** System must be operable by developers and AI agents from IDE

[Source: docs/prd/07-7-epic-2-details-designer-workflow-enablement.md]
- **Epic Goal:** "Establish a secure, remote source of truth in GitHub"
- **Success Criteria:** "Centralized, secure, and collaborative location for our source of truth"

### Repository Configuration Requirements

**Essential Repository Settings:**
- **Visibility:** Depends on organization requirements (private/public)
- **Branch Protection:** Main branch must be protected for stability
- **Topics:** Design system, tokens, multi-brand, figma, style-dictionary
- **Description:** Clear description for team discoverability

**File Structure to Push:**
```
design-system-tooling/
├── .github/workflows/          # CI/CD pipeline (ready for future automation)
├── docs/                      # Complete project documentation
├── scripts/                   # Production consolidate, split, import-export
├── src/                       # TypeScript utilities
├── tokens/                    # Complete 7-token set working directory
├── dist/                      # Compiled JavaScript (included in repo)
├── tests/                     # Comprehensive test suite

├── README.md                  # 452 lines comprehensive documentation
└── style-dictionary.config.json # Ready for Epic 3
```

**Critical Files for Token Studio Integration:**
- `tokensource.json` - Must be accessible via raw GitHub URL
- `README.md` - Must display designer setup instructions
- `docs/` - Complete documentation for designer onboarding

### GitHub Integration Patterns

**Raw GitHub URL Format:**
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{username}/{repo-name}/main/tokensource.json
```

**Branch Protection Configuration:**
- Require pull request reviews: ✓ Minimum 1 reviewer
- Dismiss stale reviews: ✓ When new commits pushed
- Require review from code owners: ✓ (when CODEOWNERS file added)
- Restrict pushes to matching branches: ✓ Force PR workflow
- Require status checks: ✓ (ready for CI/CD integration)

**Repository Topics for Discoverability:**
- `design-system`
- `design-tokens`
- `multi-brand`
- `figma-tokens`
- `token-studio`
- `style-dictionary`
- `typescript`

### Security and Access Control

**Branch Protection Benefits:**
- Prevents direct pushes to main branch
- Ensures all changes go through review process
- Maintains stability of tokensource.json for designers
- Enables automated testing before merge (future CI/CD)

**Collaboration Readiness:**
- Repository structure supports team development
- Documentation enables independent contributor onboarding
- Protected workflows prevent accidental breaking changes
- Issue/PR templates guide proper contribution process
