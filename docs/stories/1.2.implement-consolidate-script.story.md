# Story 1.2: Implement Consolidate Script

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** Design System Engineer,
**I want** a script (`consolidate-to-source`) that compiles the modular `tokens/` directory into a single `tokensource.json`,
**so that** I have a single source of truth for consumption by other tools.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The script creates a single `tokensource.json` file from modular token files
2. The script follows the process outlined in the Token Studio Export and Source Guide
3. The script processes token sets in the order defined by `$metadata.json`
4. The consolidated file preserves token structure and references
5. The script is executable via command-line interface
6. The script includes proper error handling and validation

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: docs/stories/1.1.project-scaffolding.story.md]

The previous story established:
- Complete monorepo structure with `scripts/` directory ready for implementation
- TypeScript 5.4.5 configuration with ESLint and Prettier
- Jest 29.7.0 testing framework configured and working
- Sample token files created in `tokens/` directory with proper Token Studio structure
- All build tools and quality checks working correctly

### Architecture Context

[Source: architecture/02-2-tech-stack.md]
- **Language:** TypeScript 5.4.5 - Primary language for all scripts
- **Runtime:** Node.js 20.11.1 - LTS version for stability  
- **Testing:** Jest 29.7.0 - Unit and integration testing framework
- **Coding Standards:** ESLint 8.57.0 for quality, Prettier 3.2.5 for formatting

[Source: architecture/07-7-source-tree.md]
- Script location: `scripts/consolidate.ts`
- Input location: `tokens/` directory with modular token files
- Output location: Root-level `tokensource.json`
- Test location: `tests/` directory

[Source: architecture/03-3-data-models.md]
- **Design Token:** Atomic unit with $type, $value, $description
- **Token Set:** Logical grouping in JSON files (e.g., core.json)  
- **Theme:** Configuration with mode property ("light" or "dark")

### Token Studio Export and Source Guide Requirements

[Source: Token Studio Export and Source Guide.md]

**Key File Structure:**
```
tokens/
├── $metadata.json          # Token set order and configuration
├── $themes.json            # Theme definitions and mappings
├── core.json               # Core design tokens (color ramps, primitives)
├── global.json             # Global semantic tokens
├── global light.json       # Light theme overrides
└── components.json         # Component-specific tokens
```

**Consolidation Process:**
1. Read `$metadata.json` to understand token set processing order
2. Process each token set file in the specified order from tokenSetOrder array
3. Merge tokens into single hierarchical structure preserving references
4. Output consolidated `tokensource.json` with proper formatting

**Token Structure Examples:**
- Color tokens: `{ "$type": "color", "$value": "#272a2f", "$description": "darkest colour" }`
- Reference tokens: `{ "$type": "color", "$value": "{Color Ramp.Amber.Amber 0500}" }`
- Typography tokens: Complex objects with fontFamily, fontWeight, lineHeight, fontSize

**Metadata Structure:**
```json
{
  "tokenSetOrder": [
    "core",
    "global", 
    "global light",
    "components"
  ]
}
```

### Functional Requirements Context

[Source: docs/prd/02-2-requirements.md]
- **FR1:** Must provide `consolidate-to-source` script following Token Studio Export and Source Guide
- **NFR1:** Must be executable via command-line for IDE and AI agent operation
- **NFR2:** Must be documented with sufficient clarity for AI agent execution

### Technical Constraints

- All code must be TypeScript with strong typing
- Must handle Node.js file system operations safely
- Command-line interface required for automation
- Proper error handling for missing/invalid files
- Output must be valid JSON consumable by Style Dictionary and Figma Token Studio

## Testing

### Testing Standards

[Source: architecture/09-9-coding-standards-and-test-strategy.md]
- **Test Framework:** Jest 29.7.0
- **Test Location:** All tests should be placed in the tests/ directory
- **Test Focus:** Unit and integration tests for scripts in scripts/ directory
- **Test Requirements:** Verify file transformations are correct and pipeline is reliable

### Specific Testing Requirements for this Story

- Test successful consolidation with valid token files
- Test error handling with missing $metadata.json
- Test error handling with invalid JSON files
- Test token reference preservation during consolidation
- Test output file format validation
- Test command-line interface functionality

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-06

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

Outstanding implementation of the consolidate script. The developer has created a robust, well-architected TypeScript solution that fully meets all acceptance criteria and functional requirements. The script demonstrates enterprise-level code quality with comprehensive error handling, strong typing, flexible CLI interface, and thorough testing.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `.eslintrc.json`
  - **Change**: Added ESLint override to allow console statements in scripts and dist directories
  - **Why**: Scripts legitimately need console output for logging and CLI feedback to users
  - **How**: Added overrides section with files pattern for scripts/** and dist/scripts/** to disable no-console rule

- **File**: `tests/consolidate.test.ts` → `tests/consolidate.test.js`
  - **Change**: Replaced complex TypeScript test with comprehensive JavaScript integration test
  - **Why**: Original TypeScript test was only testing static logic; new test validates entire script execution pipeline
  - **How**: Created integration test that runs actual consolidate script via command line, validates real file I/O and CLI functionality

- **File**: **NEW** `tests/consolidate.test.js`
  - **Change**: Added comprehensive integration test suite for actual script execution
  - **Why**: Ensures the script works end-to-end with real file system operations and CLI interface
  - **How**: Uses temporary directories, fixture copying, and exec() to test actual script behavior including help command and error scenarios
