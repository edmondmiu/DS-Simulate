## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**Story 1.1 (Project Scaffolding):**
- Established complete monorepo structure with proper TypeScript configuration
- All required dependencies installed and working (TypeScript 5.4.5, Node.js 20.11.1, Jest 29.7.0)
- Testing framework configured with comprehensive quality checks

**Story 1.2 (Implement Consolidate Script):**
- Production-ready consolidate script: `scripts/consolidate.ts`
- CLI options: `--help`, `--verbose`, `--tokens-dir`, `--output`
- Successfully consolidates project tokens (4 sets → 2028 bytes tokensource.json)
- Comprehensive error handling and token reference validation

**Story 1.3 (Implement Split Script):**
- Production-ready split script: `scripts/split.ts`
- CLI options: `--help`, `--verbose`, `--dry-run`, `--no-backup`, `--source`, `--tokens-dir`
- Perfect round-trip compatibility (2028 bytes → split → consolidate → 2028 bytes identical)
- Automatic backup creation with timestamped directories
- Advanced safety features including dry-run mode

### Architecture Context

[Source: architecture/02-2-tech-stack.md]
- **Language:** TypeScript 5.4.5 - Primary language for all scripts
- **Runtime:** Node.js 20.11.1 - LTS version for stability  
- **Package Manager:** npm 10.2.4 - Managing project dependencies
- **Testing:** Jest 29.7.0 - Unit and integration testing framework
- **Coding Standards:** ESLint 8.57.0 for quality, Prettier 3.2.5 for formatting

[Source: architecture/07-7-source-tree.md]
- **Project Structure:** Monorepo with scripts/, tokens/, dist/, tests/ directories
- **Documentation Location:** Root-level README.md
- **Script Locations:** scripts/consolidate.ts, scripts/split.ts

[Source: architecture/03-3-data-models.md]
- **Design Token:** Atomic unit with $type, $value, $description
- **Token Set:** Logical grouping in JSON files (e.g., core.json)  
- **Theme:** Configuration with mode property ("light" or "dark")

### Token Studio Export and Source Guide Requirements

[Source: Token Studio Export and Source Guide.md]

**Documentation Must Cover:**

**Token Directory Structure:**
```
tokens/
├── $metadata.json          # Token set order and configuration
├── $themes.json            # Theme definitions and mappings
├── core.json               # Core design tokens (color ramps, primitives)
├── global.json             # Global semantic tokens
├── global-light.json       # Light theme overrides
└── components.json         # Component-specific tokens
```

**Consolidated Format:**
```
tokensource.json            # Single source of truth (2028 bytes in current project)
```

**Bidirectional Workflow:**
1. **Edit Workflow:** tokensource.json → split → edit tokens/ → consolidate → tokensource.json
2. **Design Workflow:** tokens/ → consolidate → tokensource.json → (future: Figma integration)

### Functional Requirements Context

[Source: docs/prd/02-2-requirements.md]
- **NFR2:** Documentation must have sufficient clarity for AI agent execution
- **FR1:** Must document consolidate-to-source script usage

### Technical Documentation Requirements

**Based on successful implementations:**
- All CLI commands must be documented with working examples
- Error scenarios and troubleshooting guidance required
- File structure explanations with actual project examples

- Round-trip validation workflow must be explained clearly

**AI-Agent Friendly Requirements:**
- Step-by-step procedures with exact commands
- Clear input/output examples
- Troubleshooting section with specific error messages
- Integration examples for automated workflows

### Current Project State to Document

**Available Scripts:**
- `npm run consolidate` - Runs consolidate script
- `npm run split` - Runs split script  
- `npm test` - Runs Jest test suite
- `npm run lint` - Runs ESLint checks
- `npm run build` - TypeScript compilation

**Current Token Files (to use in examples):**
- 4 token sets in tokens/ directory
- 2028-byte tokensource.json successfully generated
- Perfect round-trip compatibility verified

**Key Features to Highlight:**
- Bidirectional pipeline with byte-perfect round-trip validation
- Professional CLI interfaces with comprehensive help systems
- Automatic backup and safety features
- Integration with Token Studio format specifications
- Enterprise-grade error handling and validation

## Testing

### Testing Standards

[Source: architecture/09-9-coding-standards-and-test-strategy.md]
- Documentation should be validated by testing all examples
- Commands and workflows should be verified to work as documented
- Examples should use actual project files and produce expected results

### Specific Testing Requirements for this Story

- Test all documented CLI commands to ensure they work as written
- Verify file structure examples match actual project structure
- Validate workflow examples produce expected results
- Test troubleshooting scenarios match actual error conditions
- Ensure all paths and filenames are accurate
