## üé® OKLCH Color Generator

**File**: `scripts/oklch-color-generator.cjs`

### Purpose
Research tool for generating mathematically precise color ramps using OKLCH color space for Epic 4 development and validation.

### Quick Usage
```bash
node scripts/oklch-color-generator.cjs
```

### Key Capabilities
- **Perceptual Uniformity** - Generate color ramps with equal visual steps
- **3D Effect Optimization** - Subtle surface variations for interface depth
- **Mathematical Curves** - Linear, easeIn, easeOut, and B√©zier progressions
- **Multi-Format Output** - OKLCH, hex, RGB conversion support
- **Accessibility Validation** - Built-in WCAG compliance checking

### Example Output
```javascript
// Generated 9-step brand ramp:
{
  step: "0400",
  oklch: "oklch(45.67% 0.123 260.1)",
  hex: "#3a3d42",
  values: { l: 0.4567, c: 0.123, h: 260.1 }
}
```

### Use Cases
- Epic 4 color ramp research and development
- Brand color harmony analysis
- Accessibility validation for new color systems
- Mathematical color relationship exploration

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Tool Classification
These are **research and validation utilities** for Design System Engineers, not:
- End-user design tools
- Part of the standard Token Studio workflow
- Required for daily designer operations
- Production system dependencies

### Proper Usage
- **Research Phase** - Use during color system development and enhancement
- **Validation Phase** - Verify Epic 4 implementations and color relationships
- **Analysis Phase** - Understand existing color systems and improvement opportunities
- **Documentation Phase** - Generate technical specifications and quality metrics

### Not for Direct Design Work
Designers should use the standard Token Studio workflow. These tools support the system engineering that makes that workflow possible.
